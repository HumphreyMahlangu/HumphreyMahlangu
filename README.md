Backend-focused Software Developer passionate about building reliable, transaction-safe systems.

I specialize in **Java and Spring Boot**, with a strong focus on financial integrity, clean architecture, and well-tested backend systems.  
I care about how applications behave under real-world constraints — concurrency, consistency, and scalability.

Currently expanding into **cloud computing and distributed systems**, with a focus on production-ready backend architecture.
